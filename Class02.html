NPM - <p>To deploy our react app we need lot of packages for this we need package manager NPM is managing same for us .Example - npm , yarn</p>
Parcel - <p>To deploy react app on production we need something which can manage bundling , minification, optimization, 
dependencies of our react app for that we need webpack which is called parcel tehre are lot more parcel is available in market like parcel , webpack.
parcel is managing all dependencies for us in our react appliation </p>
parcel-cache -<p> when we do init the react app and everytime we build the application parcel-cache folder is getting created which stored all the change versions
 when we build the file as soon as we save the change in browser the change is it reflecting to make the loading of the page faster parcel-cache is getting created.</p>
 npx- <p>Execute entry point with parcel for that we need npx , excute the app we need npx.</p>
 dependencies -<p> All the packages that project need is called dependencies which is globally needed .</p>
 devDependencies - <p>npm install -D parcel - will install all the packages which is require for our development for project  </p>
 package-lock.json - <p>It has exact version which we require for our project never put this file in gitignore we should not modify 
    this file as it has the exact version of dependencies which we require on production</p>
 package.json - <p>It has parcel version mentioned which we require for development if caret is there it will automaticaly update to latest version  </p> 
Caret -  <p>It is present in package.json file which represent the compatible version of parcel </p>
Tild - <p>It is present in package.json file which represent version number and upgrades to major versions automaticaly</p>
Hot Module Replacement - <p>When we do code changes browser automaticaly reflects the changes which is due to parcel .
    It uses internally Hot module Replacement which uses File watcher algorithm </p> 
    <p>Parcel Features </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bundling - bundles all the css and jss file </li>
        <li>Minification - removes unwanted spaces from js and css files</li>
        <li>HMR - immediately reflects the changes on browser as soon as we do changes in code </li>
        <li> Image optimization - Media and video files are heaviest files in our application parcel internally manages its optimization</li>
        <li>Cleaning code - It internally uses mechanism to clean our code and give us compressed version of file on production build</li>
    </ul>
    gitignore - <p>It is the file where we mention all the files name which we do not require on production server it is specific to development machine.<br> 
        Files specific to development machine we add it here files related to production server we donot add it here .basically files to commit we donot add it here.</p>
node_modules - <p> All packages present in node_modules which is required by app and parcel its kind of database for npm .Its not good idea to puch node_modules because its huge in size </p>
dist folder - production ready minified files get created after production build which is in dist folder
browserlist - To make our app to work on older versions of browsers we need browserlist where we specify the browser names 
Tree Shaking - <p> Removal of dead code in javascript context is called tree shaking  it depends on import and export staments  to detect 
    if code modules are exported and imported for use between javascript files  now a days bundles will do automatically</p>
